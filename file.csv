Reviews:  If you want a 5-passenger SUV that offers great looks, playful driving manners, impressive technology and good value, the 2014 Mazda CX-5 deserves a test-drive. That it boasts class-leading fuel economy of up to 35 mpg feels like icing on an already tasty cake. Source: KBB.com  Engaging driving experience; fuel-efficient engines; sharp styling. Source: Edmunds  Introducing a feat of engineering previously thought to be impossible: the crossover without compromise. Not only does the Mazda CX-5 offer confident driving, versatility, all-weather capability, spaciousness and advanced features, but it does so with amazing highway MPG. To make this possible Mazda developed an engineering philosophy called SKYACTIV TECHNOLOGY, including a new 2.5L SKYACTIV-G gas engine, which reimagines every component to work together in unprecedented harmony. CX-5's aerodynamic curves and sloping roofline reduce wind turbulence and allow for the vehicle's weight to be distributed toward the rear axle for increased stability. CX-5 is packed with advanced features that adjust to your driving needs, such as available rain-sensing windshield wipers, heated side mirrors, and 17 to 19 inch aluminum alloy wheels fitted with all-season tires. With CX-5's SKYACTIV-G 2.0L gasoline engine it produces 155 horsepower and an impressive 150 lb-ft torque delivering an EPA estimated 35 MPG hwy. For extra power and torque, upgrade to the 2.5L SKYACTIV-G. It's quick off the line with 184 horsepower yet still surprisingly fuel-efficient. CX-5 features two transmission options: the ultra-responsive 6-speed manual and the 6-speed Sport automatic. The Mazda CX-5 blends sophisticated details, like available double stitched premium leather trimmed seats, a power moonroof, and ample passenger and cargo volume (64.8 cubic feet) to create a stylish all-purpose cabin. Crisp, immersive sound is delivered through an available 9 speaker Bose Centerpoint Surround Sound System with AudioPilot noise compensation technology. Connect your iPod or other MP3 device with the USB audio input or auxiliary jack. CX-5 offers available HD Radio, Pandora Internet radio connectivity and SiriusXM Satellite Radio. The available fully integrated in dash navigation system powered by TomTom with a 5.8 inch full color touch screen display features intuitive voice recognition.
